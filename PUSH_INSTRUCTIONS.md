# 🚀 How to Deploy Your LightBoost Demo to GitHub Pages

## ✅ What's Done (Locally)

I've created and committed these changes to your local git repository:

1. **`lightboost-demo.html`** - Complete demo page (456 lines)
2. **`index.html`** - Updated with "⚡ LightBoost Demo" tab

**Commit:** `61eefd7` - "Add LightBoost AI ultra-fast voice agent demo"

## ❌ Why You Can't See It Yet

The changes are **committed locally** but **NOT pushed to GitHub**.

Your GitHub Pages site still shows the old version because the new files are only on your local machine.

## 🔧 How to Push to GitHub (3 Options)

### Option 1: Command Line (Fastest)

```bash
cd ~/klementmultiverse.github.io
git push origin main
```

If you get authentication errors, you may need to:
- Set up a GitHub Personal Access Token
- Configure SSH keys
- Or use GitHub Desktop

### Option 2: GitHub Desktop

1. Open GitHub Desktop
2. Select the `klementmultiverse.github.io` repository
3. You should see "1 commit ahead"
4. Click "Push origin" button

### Option 3: Manual Web Upload

1. Go to https://github.com/klementmultiverse/klementmultiverse.github.io
2. Upload `lightboost-demo.html` (new file)
3. Edit `index.html` to add the demo tab link (line 278)

## 🎯 After Pushing

Your demo page will be live at:
**https://klementmultiverse.github.io/lightboost-demo.html**

The "⚡ LightBoost Demo" tab will appear in your navigation bar.
